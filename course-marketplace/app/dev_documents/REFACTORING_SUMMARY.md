# Course Marketplace Refactoring Summary

This document outlines the major refactoring changes made to improve the code organization, maintainability, and reusability of the Course Marketplace application.

## 1. API Layer Refactoring

Created a structured API layer to separate data access concerns:

- Created `app/lib/api/` directory to house all API functionality
- Extracted Supabase calls into domain-specific files:
  - `auth.js` - Authentication-related functions
  - `profiles.js` - User profile management functions
  - `courses.js` - Course data operations
- Added an `index.js` file to provide a clean export interface
- Cleaned up `supabase.js` to only manage the client connection

## 2. UI Component Refactoring

Created reusable UI components to standardize the interface and reduce duplication:

### UI State Components
- `LoadingState.js` - Consistent loading indicators
- `ErrorState.js` - Error handling and display
- `EmptyState.js` - Empty data state handling

### Form Components
- `TextField.js` - Standardized form input with validation
- `Button.js` - Flexible button component with multiple variants

### Layout Components
- `PageContainer.js` - Consistent page layout wrapper
- `CourseCard.js` - Reusable course display component
- Updated `CourseGrid.js` to use `CourseCard`

### Module Organization
- Added `components/ui/index.js` to provide clean exports

## 3. Page Refactoring

Updated pages to use the new components and API utilities:

- `courses/page.js` - Uses PageContainer, LoadingState, ErrorState, EmptyState, and CourseCard
- `courses/[id]/page.js` - Completely rebuilt using new components
- `login/page.js` - Updated to use TextField and Button components

## 4. Authentication Refactoring

- Updated `AuthProvider.js` to use the extracted API functions
- Improved error handling and state management

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Code Organization:**
   - Separation of concerns between UI, data fetching, and business logic
   - Clearly named components and functions

2. **Enhanced Maintainability:**
   - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle applied throughout
   - Consistent patterns for data fetching and error handling

3. **Better Reusability:**
   - UI components can be reused across different pages
   - API utilities provide a standardized interface for data operations

4. **Simplified Page Components:**
   - Pages focus on composition rather than implementation details
   - Cleaner JSX with less inline styling and logic

5. **Consistent Error Handling:**
   - Standardized approach to loading states, errors, and empty states across the app
