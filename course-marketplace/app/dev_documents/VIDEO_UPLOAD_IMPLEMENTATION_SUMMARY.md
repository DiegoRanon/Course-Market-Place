## Features Implemented

1. **Video Upload UI**

   - Added video upload section to the CourseForm component
   - Implemented file type validation (MP4, WebM, OGG)
   - Added file size limit (500MB)
   - Created video preview functionality

2. **Backend Storage Integration**

   - Configured Supabase storage for course videos
   - Implemented secure upload with metadata
   - Added proper error handling for upload failures

3. **Course Page Video Display**

   - Added VideoPlayer component for course videos
   - Implemented responsive video playback
   - Created fallback to thumbnail when no video is available

4. **RLS Policy Fixes**
   - Fixed permission issues for video uploads
   - Ensured proper access control for both admins and creators
   - Maintained security while allowing necessary operations

## Implementation Details

### 1. CourseForm Component Updates

The CourseForm component was updated to handle video uploads with proper RLS policies:

```javascript
// Upload with metadata to help with RLS policies
const { data: uploadData, error: uploadError } = await supabase.storage
  .from("course-videos")
  .upload(fileName, file, {
    upsert: true,
    metadata: {
      role: profile?.role || "admin",
      user_id: user?.id,
    },
  });

// Add video URL if available
if (videoFile && videoUrl && videoUrl.startsWith("http")) {
  courseData.video_url = videoUrl;
}
```

### 2. RLS Policy Updates

Created SQL scripts to fix the RLS policies:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload course videos
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload course videos" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'course-videos' AND
  auth.uid() IN (SELECT user_id FROM profiles WHERE role = 'admin' OR role = 'creator')
);

-- Allow public access to course videos
CREATE POLICY "Allow public access to course videos" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'course-videos');
```

### 3. Automated Fix Scripts

Created Node.js scripts to apply the SQL fixes:

- `fix-course-video-rls.js` - Applies the RLS policy fixes for videos

### 4. Testing

Implemented comprehensive testing:

- Unit tests in `admin-upload-video.test.js`
- Manual test plan for video upload functionality
- RLS policy verification tests

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: RLS Policy Violations

**Problem**: When uploading videos, users encountered "new row violates row-level security policy" errors.

**Solution**:

1. Identified missing storage policies for the course-videos bucket
2. Created proper RLS policies for both admin and creator roles
3. Added metadata to uploads to help with RLS policy evaluation

### Challenge 2: Video URL Handling

**Problem**: Video URLs weren't being properly set in the course data before submission.

**Solution**:

1. Updated the handleVideoUpload function to properly set the video URL
2. Added validation to ensure only valid URLs are included in the course data
3. Fixed the handleSubmit function to properly include the video URL

## Future Improvements

1. **Chunked Uploads**: Implement chunked uploads for better handling of large video files
2. **Video Processing**: Add server-side video processing for optimized playback
3. **Progress Tracking**: Implement video progress tracking for enrolled students
4. **Advanced Playback Controls**: Add more advanced video player controls and features

## Documentation

The following documentation was created or updated:

- `COURSE_VIDEO_RLS_FIX.md`: Detailed explanation of the RLS policy fix
- `RLS_POLICY_FIX_SUMMARY.md`: Summary of all RLS policy fixes
- `MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md`: Updated with video upload testing steps
- `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`: Updated with video upload implementation tasks

## Conclusion

The course video upload feature has been successfully implemented with proper RLS policies. Users can now upload videos for courses, and the system correctly handles permissions for both admin and creator roles. The feature has been thoroughly tested and documented for future reference.
