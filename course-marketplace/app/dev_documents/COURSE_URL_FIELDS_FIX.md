# Course URL Fields Fix

## Issue

The courses table in the database has inconsistent field names for storing URLs:

- `thumbnail_url` is the correct field name for storing the course thumbnail image URL, but the code was using `image_url` in some places
- `courseVideo_url` is a duplicate field that should be consolidated with `video_url`

This inconsistency caused issues when uploading and displaying course thumbnails and videos.

## Root Cause

The database schema defined in `IMPLEMENT_COURSE_TABLES.sql` uses the field names `thumbnail_url` and `video_url`, but some parts of the application code were using different field names:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS courses (
  ...
  thumbnail_url text,
  courseVideo_url text,
  video_url text,
  ...
);
```

The `CourseForm.js` component was using `image_url` instead of `thumbnail_url` when uploading thumbnails, which caused the thumbnails to not be displayed correctly on the course detail page.

## Solution

We implemented the following fixes:

1. Updated the `CourseForm.js` component to use the correct field names:

   - Changed `image_url` to `thumbnail_url` for storing the course thumbnail URL
   - Ensured `video_url` is used consistently for storing the course video URL

2. Created a SQL migration script (`UPDATE_COURSE_URL_FIELDS.sql`) to:

   - Move data from `courseVideo_url` to `video_url` if needed
   - Remove the redundant `courseVideo_url` column
   - Move data from `image_url` to `thumbnail_url` if needed
   - Remove the `image_url` column if it exists
   - Add appropriate indexes and comments to the columns

3. Created a JavaScript script (`fix-course-url-fields.js`) to run the SQL migration

4. Updated tests to verify that the correct field names are used

## Implementation Details

### CourseForm.js Changes

```javascript
// Add thumbnail URL if available - use the correct field name
if (thumbnailFile && thumbnailUrl && thumbnailUrl.startsWith("http")) {
  courseData.thumbnail_url = thumbnailUrl; // Changed from image_url
}

// Add video URL if available - use the correct field name
if (videoFile && videoUrl && videoUrl.startsWith("http")) {
  courseData.video_url = videoUrl;
}
```

### SQL Migration

The SQL migration script performs the following operations:

1. Checks if the `courseVideo_url` column exists and if so:

   - Moves data from `courseVideo_url` to `video_url` if `video_url` is empty
   - Drops the `courseVideo_url` column

2. Checks if the `image_url` column exists and if so:

   - Moves data from `image_url` to `thumbnail_url` if `thumbnail_url` is empty
   - Drops the `image_url` column

3. Adds comments to the columns for better documentation
4. Creates indexes on the URL columns for better query performance

## Testing

Tests were written to verify that:

1. The correct field names are used when uploading thumbnails and videos
2. The URLs are correctly stored in the database
3. The URLs are correctly displayed on the course detail page

All tests are now passing, confirming that the issue has been resolved.
