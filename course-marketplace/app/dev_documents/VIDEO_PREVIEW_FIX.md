# Video Preview Fix

## Issue

The video preview feature was not displaying videos correctly on course pages. When users clicked the play button on a course thumbnail, the video player would appear but no video would play.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the code, we identified several issues:

1. **Video Element Configuration**: The `VideoPlayer` component was not properly using the `secureVideoUrl` state variable to set the `src` attribute of the video element.

2. **Error Handling**: The error handling in the `VideoPlayer` component was not properly structured, causing the video element to be rendered even when there were errors.

3. **Video Controls**: The video controls were not showing up correctly due to conditional rendering issues.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Video Element Configuration

- Updated the video element to properly use the `secureVideoUrl` state variable
- Added proper conditional rendering to only show the video element when there are no errors
- Added event handlers to properly update the playing state

```jsx
{
  !error && (
    <video
      ref={videoRef}
      src={secureVideoUrl}
      className="w-full h-full object-contain"
      preload="metadata"
      playsInline
      data-testid="video-element"
      onPlay={() => setIsPlaying(true)}
      onPause={() => setIsPlaying(false)}
    />
  );
}
```

### 2. Improved Error Handling

- Enhanced the error display to provide better user feedback
- Added data-testid attributes to make the component more testable
- Properly structured the conditional rendering to prevent the video element from showing when there are errors

```jsx
{
  error && (
    <div className="relative bg-black text-white flex items-center justify-center h-full w-full min-h-[200px]">
      <div className="text-center p-4">
        <p className="text-red-500 mb-2" data-testid="error-title">
          Error loading video
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm" data-testid="error-message">
          {error}
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Video Controls

- Improved the visibility of video controls based on user interaction
- Added proper SVG icons for better visual feedback
- Fixed the progress bar styling and functionality

```jsx
{
  !error && secureVideoUrl && (
    <div
      className={`absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0 bg-gradient-to-t from-black to-transparent px-4 py-2 transition-opacity duration-300 ${
        showControls || !isPlaying ? "opacity-100" : "opacity-0"
      }`}
    >
      {/* Progress bar and controls... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Testing

We created comprehensive tests to verify the fix:

1. **VideoPlayer Component Tests**:

   - Test for direct URL handling
   - Test for storage path handling for course videos
   - Test for storage path handling for protected videos
   - Test for error handling
   - Test for missing video URL handling

2. **Video Display Tests**:
   - Test for video player display when video_url is provided and showVideo is toggled
   - Test for no video player display when video_url is not provided
   - Test for thumbnail display when video is not playing

All tests are now passing, confirming that the video preview feature is working correctly.

## Additional Improvements

- Added better logging to help with debugging
- Improved the user experience with smoother transitions
- Enhanced accessibility with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- Added data-testid attributes for better testability

## Conclusion

The video preview feature is now working correctly. Users can click on the play button on a course thumbnail to view the course video. The video player provides proper controls for playback, volume, and fullscreen viewing.
