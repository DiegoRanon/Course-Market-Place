# Course Enrollment Navigation

This document outlines the implementation of the course enrollment navigation feature, which intelligently directs users to the appropriate page when clicking on a course based on their enrollment status.

## Feature Overview

When a user clicks on a course card:
- If the user is enrolled in the course, they are redirected to the learning page (`/learn/[courseId]`) where they can immediately continue their progress
- If the user is not enrolled, they are redirected to the course details page (`/courses/[id]`) where they can learn about the course and choose to enroll
- An "Enrolled" badge is displayed on course cards for courses the user is already enrolled in

## Implementation Details

### CourseCard Component

The CourseCard component has been updated to:
1. Check enrollment status when the component mounts
2. Display an "Enrolled" badge for enrolled courses
3. Handle navigation based on enrollment status when clicked

Key modifications:
- Added a state variable to track enrollment status
- Added a useEffect hook to check enrollment when the component mounts
- Replaced the Link component with a div that uses onClick to handle custom navigation
- Added visual indication of enrollment status

### Enrollment API

The existing `checkEnrollmentStatus` function in `enrollments.js` is used to determine if a user is enrolled in a course. The function:
- Takes user ID and course ID as parameters
- Returns the enrollment record if found, or null if not enrolled
- Handles errors gracefully to avoid breaking the user experience

## Testing

The feature has been tested with:
- Unit tests for the CourseCard component's navigation behavior
- Manual testing to verify the visual indicators and navigation paths

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for this feature:
1. Add caching for enrollment status to reduce database queries
2. Add progress indicators to show course completion percentage on course cards
3. Implement prefetching of enrollment data to improve perceived performance
