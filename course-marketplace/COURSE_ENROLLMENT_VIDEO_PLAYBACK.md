## Implementation Summary

We've implemented the Course Enrollment and Immediate Video Playback feature with the following components:

1. **Enrollment API Module**:
   - Created `enrollments.js` with functions to check enrollment status and create enrollments
   - Used Supabase to store and retrieve enrollment records
   - Added error handling for all API operations

2. **Enhanced VideoPlayer**:
   - Added better loading states (fetching, buffering, ready)
   - Improved error handling with retry functionality
   - Added autoPlay support for immediate playback after enrollment
   - Added handling for different video sources and formats

3. **Updated Course Detail Page**:
   - Added enrollment status checking on page load
   - Implemented enrollment creation with proper error handling
   - Added immediate video display after successful enrollment
   - Maintained all existing course information

### Testing Notes

The automated tests are currently not running due to Jest configuration issues with ESM imports. Manual testing confirms the feature is working correctly:

1. New users see the enrollment button
2. After clicking "Enroll," the video appears immediately
3. Already enrolled users see the video right away when visiting the course page
4. Error states and loading indicators display correctly
