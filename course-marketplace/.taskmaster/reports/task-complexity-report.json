		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Next.js Project with Supabase Integration",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js and Supabase setup task into subtasks covering: 1) Initial Next.js project setup with TypeScript, 2) Supabase client configuration and environment setup, 3) Project structure and component organization, and 4) Deployment pipeline configuration.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves several distinct technical components but follows standard patterns for Next.js and Supabase integration. The complexity is moderate as it requires configuration of multiple systems and environment variables, but most steps are well-documented."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Database Schema and Models",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the database schema implementation into subtasks covering: 1) User and authentication tables, 2) Course and curriculum tables, 3) Enrollment and progress tracking tables, 4) Row Level Security policies and access control, and 5) Index optimization and performance tuning.",
			"reasoning": "This task has higher complexity due to the intricate relationships between tables, security considerations with RLS policies, and the need for proper indexing. The schema design impacts the entire application, making it a critical foundation requiring careful implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Authentication System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the authentication system implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Supabase Auth configuration, 2) Signup and login UI components, 3) Authentication context and hooks, 4) Role-based access control, 5) Email verification and password reset flows, and 6) Account management functionality.",
			"reasoning": "Authentication is highly complex due to security implications, multiple user flows (signup, login, password reset), role-based permissions, and the need to maintain state across the application. The integration with Supabase Auth adds another layer of complexity requiring careful implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Landing Page and Course Marketplace",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the landing page and marketplace development into subtasks covering: 1) Landing page components and layout, 2) Course marketplace UI with cards and grid layout, 3) Search, filtering, and sorting functionality, and 4) API endpoints and data fetching for course listings.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves both frontend design and backend data fetching with moderate complexity. The search and filtering functionality adds complexity, requiring both client and server-side implementation. The responsive design requirements across multiple components also increase the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Course Page and Video Player",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the course page and video player implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Course page layout and curriculum display, 2) Secure video player integration and customization, 3) Progress tracking and persistence, 4) Course navigation and lesson sequencing, and 5) Access control for enrolled vs. non-enrolled users.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the secure video streaming requirements, custom player controls, and progress tracking functionality. The combination of frontend UI, media handling, state management, and security considerations makes this one of the most complex features in the application."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Develop User Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the user dashboard development into subtasks covering: 1) Dashboard layout and navigation, 2) Enrolled courses display with progress indicators, 3) Progress visualization and statistics, and 4) Account settings and profile management.",
			"reasoning": "The user dashboard requires complex data aggregation from multiple tables to show enrollment and progress information. The various visualizations and interactive elements add to the complexity, along with the need to handle user profile updates and settings management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Admin Panel",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the admin panel implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Admin panel layout and navigation, 2) User management features, 3) Course management and curriculum builder, 4) Analytics dashboard and reporting, and 5) Role-based access control for administrators and creators.",
			"reasoning": "The admin panel is highly complex due to the breadth of functionality it must support, including user management, course creation tools, and analytics. The drag-and-drop curriculum builder adds significant complexity, as does the need for different permission levels between admins and creators."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Stripe Payment System",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Stripe integration into subtasks covering: 1) Stripe account and API setup, 2) Server-side payment processing API, 3) Client-side checkout implementation, 4) Webhook handling for payment confirmation, 5) Enrollment creation after successful payment, and 6) Payment history and receipt functionality.",
			"reasoning": "Payment integration has high complexity due to security requirements, the need to handle webhooks, and the critical nature of financial transactions. The integration spans both client and server sides and requires careful error handling and testing to ensure reliability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement UI/UX Enhancements and Responsive Design",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the UI/UX enhancements into subtasks covering: 1) Component library development, 2) Responsive design implementation, 3) Dark/light mode theming, 4) Animation and transition effects, and 5) Accessibility improvements.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a comprehensive design system that works across all components and pages. The complexity comes from ensuring consistency, implementing responsive layouts for all screen sizes, managing theme switching, and meeting accessibility standards throughout the application."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Analytics and Performance Optimization",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the analytics and performance optimization into subtasks covering: 1) Analytics tracking implementation, 2) Admin analytics dashboard development, 3) Frontend performance optimization, 4) Backend and database optimization, and 5) Monitoring and error tracking setup.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines multiple technical domains including analytics integration, performance optimization, and monitoring. The complexity is high due to the need to optimize across the full stack, implement meaningful analytics, and ensure the application performs well under various conditions."
