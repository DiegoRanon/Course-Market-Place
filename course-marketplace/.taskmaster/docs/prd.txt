# Risks and Mitigations

## Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: Video streaming performance issues
  **Mitigation**: Implement adaptive streaming and CDN integration

- **Risk**: Database scaling with user growth
  **Mitigation**: Implement proper indexing and query optimization; plan for potential sharding

- **Risk**: Authentication security concerns
  **Mitigation**: Leverage Supabase's secure auth system; implement proper role-based access controls

## MVP Scope
- **Risk**: Feature creep delaying launch
  **Mitigation**: Strictly prioritize core functionalities; maintain separate backlog for post-MVP enhancements

- **Risk**: Overbuilding admin features before validating core user experience
  **Mitigation**: Focus on student experience first, with minimal viable admin tools

## Resource Constraints
- **Risk**: Frontend and backend integration challenges
  **Mitigation**: Clear API contracts and documentation; regular integration testing

- **Risk**: UX consistency across different user roles and journeys
  **Mitigation**: Establish component library and design system early
