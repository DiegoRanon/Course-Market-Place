## Implementation Plan

We've implemented a comprehensive user dashboard that shows enrolled courses, learning progress, and account settings. The dashboard is responsive, with a sidebar navigation on desktop and a bottom navigation on mobile. We're using the CourseCard component for consistency and maintainability.

The dashboard now includes real data fetching from Supabase, with proper loading states, error handling, and empty states. Users can filter their courses by status (All, In Progress, Completed) and sort them by various criteria (Recent, Title, Progress). This provides a more interactive and personalized experience for users.

## Implementation Details

### Error Handling Improvements

We've improved error handling in the dashboard to handle cases where:

- No enrollments exist in the database
- API calls to fetch enrollments fail
- Course data is missing or incomplete

The system now gracefully handles these situations by:

1. Providing a "Create Demo Enrollment" button when no courses are found
2. Showing appropriate empty states with helpful messages
3. Implementing proper error boundaries to prevent crashes
4. Adding null checks throughout the data flow

### Data Flow

1. User authentication is checked via Supabase auth
2. Enrolled courses are fetched from the database
3. Progress data is calculated for each course
4. Courses are filtered and sorted based on user selection
5. UI is rendered with appropriate loading/error/empty states

### Key Components

- DashboardSidebar: Navigation for desktop view
- CourseCard: Reusable component for course display with progress
- Mobile navigation: Bottom tabs for mobile devices
- Stats cards: Overview of course progress and completion
- Filtering and sorting controls: UI for data organization

### Future Enhancements

- Add more detailed analytics on the progress page
- Implement course recommendations based on progress
- Add notification system for course updates
- Implement learning streak tracking
